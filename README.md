## Overview

In PoolTogether V5 deposits are held in prize vaults. Prize vaults are [ERC4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) compatible and are the entry point for users interacting with the PoolTogether protocol. Users deposit an underlying asset (i.e. USDC) in this contract which is then funnelled to a yield source and in exchange users receive an ERC20 token representing their share of deposits in the vault.

- Balances are stored in a TWAB Controller.
- Yield is forwarded to the Liquidator to be sold.

## Development

### Installation

You may have to install the following tools to use this repository:

- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) to compile and test contracts
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to handle environment variables
- [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) to generate the code coverage report

Install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

### Env

Copy `.envrc.example` and write down the env variables needed to run this project.

```
cp .envrc.example .envrc
```

Once your env variables are setup, load them with:

```
direnv allow
```

### Compile

Run the following command to compile the contracts:

```
npm run compile
```

### Coverage

Forge is used for coverage, run it with:

```
npm run coverage
```

You can then consult the report by opening `coverage/index.html`:

```
open coverage/index.html
```

### Code quality

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) is used to run [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and tests when committing.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io) is used to format TypeScript and Solidity code. Use it by running:

```
npm run format
```

[Solhint](https://protofire.github.io/solhint/) is used to lint Solidity files. Run it with:

```
npm run hint
```

### Tests

You can run tests with the following commands:

- **unit tests:** `npm run test`
- **fuzz tests:** `npm run fuzz`
- **invariant tests:** `npm run invariant`
- **integration tests:** `npm run integration` (*informative for which integrations have potential issues*)

### CI

A default Github Actions workflow is setup to execute on push and pull request.

It will build the contracts and run the test coverage.

You can modify it here: [.github/workflows/coverage.yml](.github/workflows/coverage.yml)

For the coverage to work, you will need to setup the relevant `{X}_RPC_URL` repository secrets in the settings of your Github repository.
